Summarize the provided article text in a concise, raw text format, extracting only the core content while ignoring HTML tags, ads, or irrelevant metadata. The summary should be neutral, factual, and based solely on the article's key pointsâ€”do not add commentary, analysis, or external information. Keep it brief (1-3 sentences).

Include the placeholder `{url}` in the summary, integrating it naturally (e.g., "According to {url},..."). Do not use prefixes like "Summary:" or "Article:".

Example output:
*A new study suggests coffee may improve longevity. Read more at {url}.*
